# Biased Recommending Experiment

## Project Overview
This project establishes a framework for an experimental study investigating how recommender systems can exploit human biases. It involves a game where human participants receive recommendations from two Deep Q-Learning agents.

**Game Mechanics:**
- Each episode consists of 20 time steps.
- At each step, Nature draws a bias probability `p` (0 to 1).
- Two agents observe `p` and choose to "Recommend" or "Not Recommend".
- The human participant observes the recommendations and chooses an agent to follow.
- A "lottery" is played based on the bias `p`.
- Rewards are distributed based on the match between the recommendation, the coin flip outcome, and the human's choice.

## Google Colab Usage
The primary interface for this experiment is the Jupyter Notebook located at:
`notebooks/experiment_interface.ipynb`

**Note:** This notebook is specifically adapted to run on **Google Colab**.

To run the experiment:
1.  Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2.  Execute the initial setup cells. These cells will:
    -   Clone the repository (`git clone ...`).
    -   Install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
    -   Mount your Google Drive (`drive.mount('/content/drive')`).
3.  The notebook sets a `dumping_path` for data storage. Ensure this path exists in your Google Drive or update it as needed.

## Data Generation and Storage
Experimental data is generated during the gameplay session and stored as JSON files.

**Mechanism:**
1.  **Buffering**: As the game proceeds, data for each step is buffered in memory within the `DataLogger` class (`src/logging.py`).
2.  **Saving**: At the end of each episode (when the `done` flag is received from the environment), the buffered data is written to a JSON file.
3.  **File Naming**: Files are named using the format `{session_id}_ep{episode_num}.json`.
4.  **Storage Location**: By default, data is saved to the `data/` directory locally, or the path specified by the user in the notebook (e.g., Google Drive).

**JSON Structure:**
Each JSON file contains a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a single time step in the episode.

**Field Descriptions:**
-   `session_id`: Unique identifier for the game session.
-   `timestamp`: ISO format timestamp of the event.
-   `episode`: The current episode number.
-   `step`: The step number within the episode.
-   `p`: The bias probability generated by nature.
-   `recommendations`: List of agent actions (1 for Recommend, 0 for Not Recommend).
-   `human_choice`: Index of the agent selected by the human (0 or 1).
-   `human_reward`: Reward received by the human.
-   `agent_rewards`: List of rewards received by the agents.
-   `outcome`: The result of the coin flip ("Heads" or "Tails").
