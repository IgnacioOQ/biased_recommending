# Housekeeping Protocol

1. Read the AGENTS.md file.
2. Look at the dependency network of the project, namely which script refers to which one.
3. Proceed doing different sanity checks and unit tests from root scripts to leaves.
4. Compile all errors and tests results into a report. And output that report.
5. Add that report to the AGENTS_LOG.md
